# Headings
To create headings we use hash symbols (#)
We can also create different "level" headings 
To create subheadings, we use multiple hashes

## This is a subheading level 2 
### This is a level 3 subheading
###### Level 6 is the smallest 

# Modifying Text Style

## Bold and Italics 
We can use asterisks (\*) to modify text style, specifically bold and italics 
I want this **word** to be bold
I want this *word* to be italicized
I want this ***word*** to be both bold and italicized
***This whole sentence is emphasized*** 

## Aside: Escape Characters
If we want to place a character that is ALREADY a **keyword** or **reserved characters** we use the back slash (\)

## Strikethrough 
We can strike through characters or words using the tilde (~)
e.g. 
Mr. Ubial knows how to spell ~~neighbor~~ neighbour
~~This whole sentence is a mistake~~ 

# Links 
Links allow us to reference information externally
[A tool **YOU** might use](https://chat.openai.com)
Exercise: 
- if you have an open ai account
	- ask chatgpt to make you two links to whatever website using markdown 
	- at the end of the links, put down "*from chatgpt*"
- if you don't
	- create two more links to some other website you think is useful 

[Visit Google](https://www.google.com/) [Visit OpenAI](https://www.openai.com/)

*from chatgpt*

## Images 
Put two images in here

# Blockquotes 
Block quotes allow us to emphasize a bigger chunk of text 
We use carets (>) to create blockquotes

e.g. 

> This is an example of a *blockquote*
> This is line two of a block quote 
> 
> This is line four of the blockquote 


# Lists 
We can create both *unordered* and *ordered* lists

## Unordered Lists 
To create each point, we use asterisks (\*) with a space behind it 
We can create a sub portion of the list by placing **TABS** before the asterisk

e.g. 

* dairy
	* eggs 
	* milk 
	* cheese 
* juice 

## Ordered Lists 
If there is a specific order to the elements in our list, we can create an ordered list 
We use numbers, followed by periods to create ordered lists 

e.g. 

1. Put butter into mixing bowl 
2. Add sugar to butter (*hold shift to create a second line*)
   Both brown and granulated sugar should be added
3. Using the mixer, cream sugar and butter together

# Tables
We can organize information in tables using Markdown 
We use dashes (-) and pipes (|). 

Tables in Markdown require headings. 

e.g. 

| Name    | Age    | Sign    | 
| ---          | ---      | ---   |
|Bruce Wayne | 35 | Aquarius |
| Mr. Ubial | Unaging | All of them |
